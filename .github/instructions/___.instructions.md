# ✅ DOs  
**What to do**

### **Keep complexity low**  
- Choose simple solutions whenever possible.  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness or excessive elegance.

### **Say “no” when needed**  
- Reject features, abstractions, and layers that don’t add real value.  
- Avoid expanding the scope without purpose.

### **Use the 80/20 principle (“ok”)**  
- Accept solutions that deliver enough value with minimal effort.  
- Don’t chase absolute perfection.

### **Refactor at the right time**  
- Let the system “reveal its shape” before creating abstractions.  
- Refactor moderately, driven by real pain points.

### **Write explicit and readable code**  
- Break complex expressions into simple steps.  
- Prefer clear names and straightforward structures.

### **Use tests with good judgment**  
- Focus on functional and mid-level integration tests.  
- Use end-to-end tests only for critical paths.

### **Respect existing solutions (Chesterton’s Fence)**  
- Before removing something, understand why it exists.  
- Assume past decisions had valid reasons.

### **Leverage good tools**  
- Master your debugger, IDE, profiler, and automation tools.  
- Use tools to eliminate repetitive errors.

### **Design simple and practical APIs**  
- Prioritize the common use case over the rare one.  
- Keep separate layers for simple vs advanced usage.

### **Write useful logging**  
- Log conditional branches and request IDs.  
- Allow dynamic adjustment of log levels.

### **Favor simple concurrency models**  
- Prefer stateless designs, work queues, and isolation.  
- Minimize shared mutable state.

### **Optimize only with real data**  
- Measure before intervening.  
- Pay special attention to network latency.

### **Acknowledge when something is hard**  
- Admit when a concept is difficult.  
- Helps juniors feel comfortable asking questions.

# ❌ DON’Ts  
**What to avoid**

### **Avoid unnecessary complexity**  
- Don’t create generic abstractions prematurely.  
- Don’t insist on “beautiful” structures that are hard to maintain.

### **Don’t fall into the trap of “doing too much”**  
- Don’t try to anticipate every future scenario.  
- Don’t introduce microservices without a strong, concrete need.

### **Don’t be dogmatic with testing**  
- Don’t demand 100% coverage.  
- Don’t replace thinking with ritual.

### **Avoid DRY taken too far**  
- Don’t abstract code just to remove a few repeated lines.  
- Don’t hide simple logic behind complex structures.

### **Be careful with over-fragmented Separation of Concerns**  
- Don’t scatter logic across many files.  
- Don’t confuse modularity with fragmentation.

### **Avoid excessive closures and “magic”**  
- Don’t sacrifice clarity for fewer lines.  
- Don’t hide behavior behind syntactic tricks.

### **Don’t use complex patterns unnecessarily**  
- Visitor Pattern, excessive layering, elaborate architectures… avoid them.  
- Apply patterns only when they truly reduce complexity.

### **Avoid tech fads without purpose**  
- Don’t adopt frameworks or trends just because of hype.  
- Don’t turn front-end/back-end into two hard systems without need.

### **Don’t optimize too early**  
- Don’t rewrite critical parts without real profiling data.  
- Don’t invest effort where there is no bottleneck.

### **Don’t pretend to understand everything**  
- Don’t hide doubts out of fear of looking “dumb”.  
- Don’t let pride block learning.
